## run gen.java
This will generate 10 random IP and MAC Addresses and store them in ip.txt and mac.txt respectively.
## run serverr.java
This will initiate the server with respective IP and MAC Addresses from ip.txt and mac.txt and transfer the used addresses to ip_used.txt and mac_used.txt
## run clientt.java
  This will initiate the client with respective IP and MAC Addresses from ip.txt and mac.txt and transfer the used addresses to ip_used.txt and mac_used.txt
